            <h3>Background</h3>

            <p>I designed and coded a website that primarily displays my prior UX projects. It took about a month total, including usability and accessibility testing.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>

            <p>I needed a website to display my UX design projects. Before creating this website, I did not have a way to show off my prior work to potential employers. This website will make the perfect companion to my resume.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Display my previous projects</li>
                <li>Provide my contact information for potential employers</li>
                <li>Provide personal information so that potential employers can get a better sense of who I am</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            
            <p>My first attempt at a portfolio website involved using the Adobe Portfolio service, which is a part of my Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. Although the site was easy to set up and display my projects, I was not completely happy with the customization options available. It was after this experience that I decided to custom code my portfolio website. Although there would be much more work up front, I valued the ability to really make this website my own. An additional benefit is that I get to highlight another skill in my personal toolbox.</p>

            <p>When considering the design of the site, I thought about its goals. Because they are few and simple, I thought the site should reflect this. The layout should be simple so that the content and information take center stage.</p>
            
			<p>Next, I chose Lato as the one font that I would use on the site because it is simultaneously professional, inviting, and easily readable. I chose a deep purple as the main color with a green as an accent because they both work well when used against a white background.</p>
			
			<p>With the visual design mostly thought out, I started coding the website. I started with the home page. Here is a screenshot of the first iteration, plain html with no styling:</p>

			<img src="img/portfolio-first-draft.PNG" alt="" class="border">

			<p>The structure is in place, so I started styling the existing html with css. After some styling, and replacing the project images, the home page looked like this:</p>

			<img src="img/portfolio-second-draft.PNG" alt="" class="border">

			<p>Since there were no more major changes to be made to the home page, I started thinking about the inner content pages. Because these pages are text heavy, I wanted them to be easily readable, with the optimal font size and characters per line. With these goals in mind, I chose an 800 pixel container and 26 pixel font size so that the average characters per line would be around 70, which lies in the 45-75 character range per line for great readability.</p>

			<p>After the basic css and structure was done, I had to consider how the website would show on smaller devices. Luckily, because my website's layout is simple, I didn't have a lot to adjust to make the website completely responsive. I made media queries that changed font sizes, and made images line up in 2s instead of 4s.</p>

			<p>After this, I wanted to add a little personal flair, so on the <a href="about.html">About Me</a> page under my written description, I added a vector image of my hometown, New Orleans. To add a little extra pizazz, I figured out which parts of the svg code corresponded to the stars in the image and added 3 sets of css animations that gives the effect of them twinkling randomly. I also added one more css animation that cycles the moon's color.</p>

			<p>After this, I only needed to make small tweaks: one example was re-cropping the LA NAACP project image so that it matched the other images. I added a simple footer to ease navigation through the site.</p>

			<p>After these changes were complete, I held a Usability Test. Participants had no trouble navigating the site and finding different content to complete the tasks given. A majority of feedback given was cosmetic in nature. One good piece of feedback gave me the idea to add a side menu to the project description pages on big screens that enable users to navigate the sections easily.</p>

			<h2>Solution</h2>

			<p>Here is the home page as of writing this case study:</p>

			<img src="img/portfolio-latest-draft.PNG" alt="">

			<p>Here is another one of the project pages, note the amount of characters per line is around 65-75:</p>

			<a href="schnitzeljagd.html"><img src="img/schnitzeljagd-snip.PNG" alt="" class="border"></a>

			<p>Here's the <a href="about.html">About Me</a> page:</p>

			<a href="about.html"><img src="img/aboutmesnip.PNG" alt="" class="border"></a>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>My initial goals were:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Display my previous projects</li>
                <li>Provide my contact information for potential employers</li>
                <li>Provide personal information so that potential employers can get a better sense of who I am</li>
			</ul>

			<p>According to the results of the Usability Test, the portfolio page is successful.</p>
