            <p>Hi, I’m Christian, an Information Systems Major turned UX Designer who has always had a passion for helping clients achieve their goals.</p>
            <p>I have extensive experience working with clients and doing the work necessary to meet their needs and have developed the ability to communicate efficiently with technical and non-technical users to get their needs met. I use these same skills when researching usability issues with real world users, making sure to get actionable information from their interviews and answers on surveys.</p>
            <p>I am naturally able to connect with these real-world users, making them more honest about the apps they are testing, which gives more accurate information for fixing usability issues. I want to use this ability to talk to real-world users to help a UX team create/improve an app that makes a positive impact in those users’ lives.</p>
